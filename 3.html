    <h2>Hong Kong Food</h2>
    <p>Food in Hong Kong is primarily based on Cantonese cuisine, despite the territory's exposure to foreign influences and its residents' varied origins. 
       Rice is the staple food, and is usually served plain with other dishes

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a> was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.</P>
